# Recipe App

The Recipe App is a rebuild of a Recipe CLI application I created. It is built using the Django web framework, transforming it into a dynamic, multi-user web application. This project adds full-stack complexity with user authentication, admin panel, and interactive features for managing and visualizing recipe data.
